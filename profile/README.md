## What is VRUI?

VRUI is both a collection of software and a community of XR developers and scientific investigators and educators who use XR for research and teaching.  

**The VRUI Developer Toolkit** provides an abstracted environment for delivering XR across a range of physical devices and display settings (CAVE, headset, AR glasses, etc.), eliminating the need for developers to code to specific hardware installations.

**VRUI Applications** are applications developed using the Developer Toolkit and deployed as part of VRUI installation to provide specific XR experiences.  For example, the [LIDAR Viewer](https://github.com/vrui-vr/lidarviewer) is an interactive application for processing,
visualization, and analysis of large 3D point cloud data
produced by terrestrial or airborne LiDAR scanning.  Links to the repositories of VRUI applications that are released as Open Source Software (OSS) and whose develper(s) commit to upholding the VRUI Code of Conduct appear in Repositores list on this page.  

**The VRUI Community** is the entire community of VRUI users and developers.  (As of March, 2025, we are aware of approximately 2,000 VRUI users).
